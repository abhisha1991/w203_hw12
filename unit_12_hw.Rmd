# OLS Inference

The file videos.txt contains data scraped from Youtube.com.  You wish to measure how much the quality of a video affects the number of views.  To proxy video quality, you have the variable *rate* which represents average user rating.  For the number of views, you have the variable *views*.

1. Using diagnostic plots and numerical tools, build a *single* model specification for this task.

2. Explain your result in terms of statistical and practical significance.

3. Identify 3 omitted variables and estimate whether they are biasing the effect you measure towards zero or away from zero.
